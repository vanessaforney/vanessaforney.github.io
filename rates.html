				<b>House Sitting</b>
				<p>I am available for house sitting at locations within the San Luis Obispo area. The cost varies depending on the number of animals you have, but I can do anything from house visits to overnights at your house. Often times, dogs are more comfortable in their home environment. Rates will vary from <b>$20 per day</b> to <b>$50 per day</b> depending on the number of pets, care, and cleaning involved.</p>

				<b>Dog Walking</b>
				<p>Dog walking (or running) is available for up to three dogs at once. The rates run around <b>$20 for a 30-minute walk</b>, and <b>$30 for an hour long walk</b>. Only $5 extra per additional dog.</p>

				<b>Dog Sitting</b>
				<p>
				Dog sitting is provided in my home for friendly, house trained, small (under 30 lbs), clean, and quiet dogs. My home is a relaxed, calm environment and we want to keep it that way! If your dog meets the criteria and gets along with my Yorkie, rates are <b>$30 to $40 per day</b> which includes a minimum of a 45 minute walk. I am very active, so in good weather I usually take the dogs to the beach, hiking, or other fun adventures. We watch only one dog at a time to keep the environment enjoyable for all parties!
