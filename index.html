		<p>Welcome to Vanessa's Dog Sitting! We provide house sitting for all animals, dog walking, and dog sitting in my home. We are available in locations within SLO. Small, quiet, friendly, and house trained dogs are welcome to stay in my home, but my focus is on house sitting and dog walking since your dog is often more comfortable in his own environment. Read more about my experience with dogs and other animals on the <a href="about-me.html">About Me</a> page.</p>
